h2. Description

test-unit-rails is a Rails adapter for test-unit 2. You can use full test-unit 2 features, "RR":https://rubygems.org/gems/rr integration and "Capybara":https://rubygems.org/gems/capybara integration with test-unit-rails.

Rails supports Test::Unit bundled in Ruby 1.8 and MiniTest but doesn't support test-unit 2. Rails with test-unit 2 works but is not fully worked.

h2. Install

You add the following codes to your Gemfile:

<pre>
group :development, :test do
  gem 'test-unit-rails'
end
</pre>

And you update bundled gems:

<pre>
% bundle update
</pre>

You replace @"require 'rails/test_help'"@ in your test/test_helper.rb with the following codes:

<pre>
# require 'rails/test_help'
require 'test/unit/rails/test_help'
</pre>

Now you can use full test-unit 2.x features, RR integration and Capybara integration.
